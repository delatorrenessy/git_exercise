# 👥 Git Collaboration Exercise

## Scenario:
Alice and Bob are working on the same project.  
- Alice creates and works on a **new feature branch**  
- Bob makes changes directly on the **main branch**  

Now, let’s practice real-world collaboration using Git!

## 📝 Instructions (for Students)

1. **Pair up** with a classmate — one of you is “Alice,” the other is “Bob.”  
2. **Clone the same repository** (or use a shared repo).  
3. **Alice**:  
   - Create a new branch:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```
   - Make a change and commit it.  
   - Push the branch:  
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

4. **Bob**:  
   - Stay on the `main` branch.  
   - Make a different change and commit it.  
   - Push your changes:  
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

5. **Switch roles** and try to **merge each other’s changes**:
   - Use `git pull` to fetch updates  
   - Use `git merge` to combine changes  
   - If there are conflicts — **try resolving them together**
